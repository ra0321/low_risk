## How to run tests:

- Run the `npm i`
- Run the `npx hardhat compile` command to compile the smart contracts
- Run the `npx hardhat test`

## üìÑ Description:

One strategy includes two contracts: **Logic** and **Storage**.

### **Logic.sol**

Provides manage depositors tokens ability to admin (oracle) strategy

#### Error codes:

- E1 - Cannot accept
- E2 - vTokens is not used
- E3 - swap is not used
- E4 - swapMaster is not used
- E5 - vToken is not used
- E6 - blid is already set
- E7 - storage is already set
- E11 - BLID deposit amount should be less
- E12 - withdraw BLID amount less than balance
- E13 - BlidPerBlock should be less
- E14 - Sender is not AccumulatedDepositor
- E15 - LeaveTokenLimit should be increased all the time

### **Storage.sol**

This contract is upgradable. Interacts with users, distributes earned BLID, and associates with Logic contract.

#### Error codes:

- E1 - token is not used
- E2 - is not logicContract
- E3 - Need more amount need than zero
- E4 - Withdraw amount exceeds balance
- E5 - Contracrt hasn't enough for interest fee, please contact the administrator
- E6 - token is already added
- E7 - You can call updateAccumulatedRewardsPerShare one time for token

### **/crosschain/CrosschainDepositor.sol**

This contract is UUPS upgradeable, provides cross-chain token deposit.

#### Error codes:

- CD1 - Token should be added via addStargateToken()
- CD2 - Token address should not be address(0)
- CD3 - Token as been added already
- CD4 - AccumulateDepositor should be added
- CD5 - Some eth is required
- CD6 - Deposit amout should be > 0
- CD7 - Transaction gas fee is too small
- CD8 - AccumulateDepositor has been added already

### **/crosschain/AccumulatedDepositor.sol**

This contract is UUPS upgradeable, provides cross-chain token accept and associates with Storage contract.

#### Error codes:

- AD1 - Storage contract has been added already
- AD2 - Token should be added via addStargateToken()
- AD3 - Token address should not be address(0)
- AD4 - Token as been added already
- AD5 - Only StargateRouter can call sgReceive() method

## BLID distribution model

Bolide Low risk Strategy distribute all earned income once X hours (often it is about 6 times a day). Users can deposit their assets and withdraw at any moment regardless of distribution schedule. To support it Bolide‚Äôs strategies use following algorithm

Let‚Äôs say we have:

- User 1 (U1) at time moment 1 (T1) deposited 2 USD (A1)
- User 2 (U2) at moment 2 (T2) deposited 2 USD (A2)
- The strategy made rewards distribution at moment 3 (t3) with 1 BLID distribution (B1)

The goal is to make an honest distribution 1 BLID between 2 users, the amounts of rewards should depend on the time before distribution and amount of users deposit.

Let's say ‚ÄúDollar Time‚Äù means the amount of deposit multiplied to the time between deposit and distribution

$$\small DollarTime(u) = A(U) * \bigtriangleup T$$

For example
$$\small DollarTime(U_1) = A(U) * ŒîT = A_1 * (T_3 - T_1) = A_1 * T_3 - A_1 * T_1 = 2 * 3 - 2 * 1 = 4$$

$$\small DollarTime(U_2) = A(U) * ŒîT = A_2 * (T_3 - T_2) = A_2 * T_3 - A_2 * T_2 = 2 * 3 - 2 * 2 = 2$$

Then ‚ÄúTotal Dollar time‚Äú

$$\small TotalDollarTime(U) = \sum_{n}^{1}DollarTime(Ui)$$

Then ‚ÄúDollar Time Distribution‚Äù means how much BLID should be distributed per 1 DollarTime.

$$\small DollarTimeDistribution(U) = \frac{B}{TotalDollarTime}$$

For our example

$$\small DollarTimeDistribution(T_3) = \frac{1}{(2+4)} = \frac{1}{6}$$

Or we can calculate DollarTimeDistribution as follows

$$\small DollarTimeDistribution(T) = \frac{B}{\sum_iAi*T-\sum_iAi*Ti}$$

Then

$$\small DollarTimeDistribution(T_3) = \frac{B_1}{(A_1 * T_3 + A_2 * T_3) - (A_1 * T_1 + A_2 * T_2)} = \frac{1}{4 * 3 - (2 * 1  + 2 * 2)} = \frac{1}{6}$$

After that, we can calculate user‚Äôs rewards as follows

$$\small Rewards(U_i) = DollarTimeDistribution(T) * DollarTime(U_i) = DollarTimeDistribution(T) * (A_i * T_d - A_i * T_i)$$

So we have

$$\small Rewards(U_1) = \frac{1}{6} * (2 * 3 - 2 * 1) = \frac{2}{3}$$

$$\small Rewards(U_2) = \frac{1}{6} * (2 * 3 - 2 * 2) = \frac{1}{3}$$

It's obvious that if user withdraw some amount of deposit than we should use Ai with ‚Äú-‚Äù sign in all calculations.

So the final formula is

$$\small Rewards(U) = DollarTimeDistribution(T) * (A_i * T_d - A_i * T_i)$$
